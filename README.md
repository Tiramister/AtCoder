## ABC / ARC

Code for AtCoder Beginner / Regular Contests.

When they are held at the same time, those codes are integrated in ABC directory.

In local directory, there are symbolic links from ARC to ABC in order to make it easy to access codes, but in github these symbolic links don't work (only displaying the path).


## AGC

Code for AtCoder Grand Contests.


## others

Codes for contests except for above in AtCoder, mainly held by companies.
